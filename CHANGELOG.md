# Changelog

All notable changes to VellumPdf will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
VellumPdf is currently **pre-1.0 beta** — the public API may still change before
the first stable release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Public-API surface lock.** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers` is
  wired to every shippable project. Any accidental addition, removal, or rename
  of a public symbol is a build error unless the corresponding
  `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` baseline is updated, guarding the API contract ahead
  of 1.0.
- **veraPDF PDF/A-2b/2u CI gate.** The official `verapdf/cli` Docker image is
  pulled on every CI run and exercises the generated archival documents (embedded
  font, table, image, and tagged variants) under strict PDF/A-2b and PDF/A-2u
  profiles. A non-compliant report fails the build with the full rule list
  attached.

### Changed

- **Deterministic output.** Document identifiers (`/ID`) and producer timestamps
  are now pinnable at the call site, so bytes produced from identical inputs are
  bit-for-bit identical across builds. This is required for reliable golden-file
  snapshot tests and for reproducible NuGet packages.

### Security

- **Font-parser hardening.** The TrueType/OpenType parser now fails cleanly on
  malformed or hostile input — throwing `InvalidDataException` on corrupt or
  truncated data and `NotSupportedException` on unsupported variants — rather than
  crashing with an unexpected exception, hanging, or exhausting memory.
- **Image-parser hardening.** The PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF parsers apply the
  same defensive posture: bounded reads, early rejection of structurally invalid
  headers, and no unbounded allocations driven by attacker-controlled length
  fields.

# Changelog

All notable changes to VellumPdf will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.6] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Arc drawing primitive.** `PdfCanvas.AppendArc(cx, cy, radius, startAngle, endAngle)` appends a
  circular arc to the current path, approximated by cubic Bézier segments (one per 90° or less).
  Angles are in radians, counter-clockwise from the +X axis in PDF space; a sweep where the end
  angle is below the start runs clockwise. It is append-only and emits no `m`, so the caller
  positions the current point at the arc start.
- **`PieChart` layout element.** Draws a pie chart as a set of filled wedges. Each `PieSlice`
  carries a value, a fill colour, and an optional label. The chart exposes a configurable start
  angle and sweep direction (clockwise by default), diameter, margins, horizontal alignment, and
  an optional per-wedge separator stroke. A lone slice is drawn as a full circle rather than a
  360° wedge, so it has no radial seam. In a tagged document the chart is written as a `/Figure`
  with alternate text, composed from the slice labels or set explicitly via `AltText`; set
  `Decorative` to mark it as an artifact instead when the data is already in accessible text
  nearby. Add it with `Document.Add(PieChart)`.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — PDF/A-2 coverage deepened across non-page content streams and XMP.**
  Build-verified veraPDF parity rises to **~92% for PDF/A-2b/2u/2a** (up from ~90%); PDF/UA-1 stays
  at **~90%**. Every rule is authored clean-room from the ISO text and cross-validated against
  veraPDF 1.30.2 in CI; adversarial false-positive sweeps across the new and changed rules found no
  over-rejections.
  - **A reusable reachable-content-stream collector** walks the non-page content streams reachable
    from each page — drawn Form XObjects (recursively, cycle-guarded), the glyph procedures of every
    Type 3 font selected by a `Tf` operator, and annotation `/AP /N` appearance streams (including
    keyed appearance sub-dictionaries). Its reachability policy is pinned empirically to veraPDF.
  - **Now applied to non-page streams** (previously page-content only): the ISO 32000-1 operator
    allowlist (§6.2.2-1) and inline-image filter check (§6.1.10-1) — both now **fully implemented**;
    plus the overprint/OPM check (§6.2.4.2-2), Separation-consistency check (§6.2.4.4-2), and the
    inherited-resource check (§6.2.2-2).
  - **PDF/A-2a logical structure:** the document structure tree presence check (§6.7.3.3-1) is now
    implemented.
  - **XMP extension schema (§6.6.2.3.3):** the PDF/A extension-schema containers are now validated
    for RDF container type and namespace prefix — `pdfaExtension:schemas` must be an `rdf:Bag`
    (§6.6.2.3.3-1), and the `property`, `valueType`, and `field` containers must be `rdf:Seq`
    (§6.6.2.3.3-5/-6/-15), honoring the XMP default-namespace (null-prefix) form.

### Fixed

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — two false positives eliminated** (a conformance rule must never reject
  a file veraPDF accepts):
  - **§6.2.4.3 (device colour spaces).** The check rejected any device colour used without a PDF/A
    output intent, ignoring `/Default*` colour spaces entirely — so a file using DeviceRGB with a
    `/DefaultRGB` colour space (and no output intent) was wrongly rejected. It now follows veraPDF's
    per-type semantics: DeviceRGB is satisfied by `/DefaultRGB` or an RGB output-intent profile,
    DeviceCMYK by `/DefaultCMYK` or a CMYK profile, and DeviceGray by `/DefaultGray` or any output
    intent.
  - **§6.2.2-2 (inherited resources).** A page lacking its own `/Resources` was flagged for *every*
    resource name it used, even names that are undefined in the inheritance chain (which veraPDF
    accepts). It now flags only names that are actually defined in the inherited resource scope.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — PDF/UA-1 and PDF/A-2a conformance deepened.** Build-verified veraPDF
  parity rises to **~90% for PDF/UA-1** (95 of 106 checks implemented, 1 partial — up from ~71%) and
  **~90% for PDF/A-2a** (up from ~87%). Every rule is authored clean-room from the ISO text and
  cross-validated against veraPDF 1.30.2 in CI; two adversarial false-positive sweeps (content-stream
  /marked-content rules and the new font rules, plus an earlier structure-rule sweep) found no
  over-rejections.
  - **A marked-content interpreter** over page content streams: BMC/BDC/EMC nesting, marked-content
    tags and properties, MCID resolution for both the inline (`/Tag << /MCID n >>`) and
    named-reference (`/Tag /Name` via `/Resources /Properties`) forms, artifact ancestry, and a
    content-item model per real-content operator. It underpins the §7.1 and §7.2 marked-content rules.
  - **Logical structure (PDF/UA-1):** table grid — cell intersection and row/column spans
    (§7.2-15/-41/-42/-43); heading nesting level (§7.4.2-1); table cell connected-header (§7.5-1/-2);
    non-standard structure types must role-map to a standard type (§7.1-5).
  - **Marked content (PDF/UA-1):** real content must be tagged or marked as Artifact, and the
    artifact/tagged-content nesting rules (§7.1-1/-2/-3); marked-content and outline natural-language
    determination (§7.2-2/-30/-31/-32/-33/-34), resolving language through the structure tree.
  - **Fonts (PDF/UA-1):** TrueType cmap and encoding requirements (§7.21.6-1/-2/-4), backed by an
    embedded copy of the Adobe Glyph List (BSD-3-Clause, attributed in `NOTICE`); glyph-width
    consistency between the font dictionary and the embedded program for Identity-H CIDFontType2
    fonts (§7.21.5-1).
  - **PDF/A-2a logical structure (§6.7):** non-standard structure-type role-mapping, RoleMap
    acyclicity, and standard-type remap rules (§6.7.3.4-1/-2/-3); `/Lang` BCP-47 syntax (§6.7.4-1).
  - Each rule documents its deferred edges; the remaining PDF/UA-1 checks are deferred with concrete
    reasons (each would either over-reject conformant files or needs a subsystem the library does not
    yet have).

## [1.7.3] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1) accessibility conformance.** Build-verified
  veraPDF parity for PDF/UA-1 rises from **~7.5% to ~71%** (75 of 106 checks implemented, 1 partial).
  Every rule is authored clean-room from the ISO text, cross-validated against veraPDF 1.30.2 in CI,
  and a 37-fixture adversarial sweep across crop-box geometry, structure-parent resolution,
  multi-hop role-mapping, font usage-scoping, and indirect references found no over-rejections.
  - **A reusable tagged-structure walker** (`/StructTreeRoot` → `/K` → `StructElem`, with role-map
    resolution to ISO 32000-1 Table 333 standard types, a `/ParentTree` reverse index for
    annotation↔structure binding, and cycle/depth guards) underpins the structure rules.
  - **Document & metadata:** file header (§6.1-1), `/Suspects` (§7.1-4), `/Lang` BCP-47 syntax
    (§7.2-29), `/RoleMap` acyclic / no-standard-remap and `/P` presence (§7.1-6/-7/-12).
  - **Logical structure:** table / list / table-of-contents containment, count and caption-position
    (§7.2-3…40); Figure & Formula alternate text (§7.3-1, §7.7-1); Note IDs (§7.9-1/-2); heading
    H/Hn consistency (§7.4.4-1/-2/-3); natural-language determination (§7.2-21…25).
  - **Annotations:** alternate descriptions and structure nesting for general, Link, Widget, and
    PrinterMark annotations (§7.18.1-1/-2, §7.18.4-1, §7.18.5-1/-2, §7.18.8-1), TrapNet (§7.18.2);
    plus optional-content configurations (§7.10), embedded-file names (§7.11), dynamic XFA
    (§7.15), and reference XObjects (§7.20).
  - **Fonts:** a content-stream glyph-extraction pass (per-glyph text rendering mode via a q/Q
    graphics-state stack and shown character codes) drives `.notdef`-reference, glyph-presence,
    and embedding checks (§7.21.4.1-1/-2, §7.21.8-1); plus CIDToGIDMap, CMap, CharSet/CIDSet,
    CIDSystemInfo, symbolic-TrueType, and used-glyph ToUnicode checks (§7.21.3.x / 4.2.x / 6-3 / 7-2).

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — digital signatures, JPEG2000, and colour/metadata checks.** Sixteen
  further PDF/A-2b/2u/2a preflight checks, taking build-verified parity to PDF/A-2b **90.3%**, 2u
  **90.4%**, 2a **87.3%** (from ~80%). All are cross-validated against veraPDF 1.30.2, and a
  whole-batch adversarial sweep against real fixtures (a genuine JPEG2000 image, B-B/B-LT/B-LTA
  signed PDFs, conformant writer output) found no over-rejections.
  - **Digital signatures** via a hand-rolled, zero-dependency CMS/ASN.1 reader (no
    `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`): the signature must include an X.509 certificate
    (§6.4.3-2) and exactly one signer (§6.4.3-3); when `/Perms /DocMDP` is present the signature
    reference dictionary must not carry `DigestLocation`/`DigestMethod`/`DigestValue` (§6.1.12-2);
    and the `/ByteRange` coverage check (§6.4.3-1).
  - **JPEG2000** (`JPXDecode`): colour-channel count, colour-space-specification APPROX field,
    `colr` METH value, no CIEJab enumerated colour space, and bit-depth constraints (§6.2.8.3-1…5).
  - **Colour:** ICCBased profile device-class/colour-space/version validity (§6.2.4.2-1); overprint
    mode must be 0 when an ICCBased-CMYK space is used with overprinting, via a content-stream
    graphics-state interpreter (§6.2.4.2-2); same-named Separation colourants must share
    tintTransform and alternateSpace (§6.2.4.4-2).
  - **Fonts / metadata / structure:** embedded-CMap WMode consistency and `usecmap`
    predefined-only (§6.2.11.3.3-2/-3); font/colourant/structure-type names must be valid UTF-8
    (§6.1.8-1); XMP extension-schema property value-type match (§6.6.2.3.1-2).

### Fixed

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` — two false positives on signed PDFs.** An invisible signature widget
  (a `/Widget` with a degenerate, zero-area `/Rect` and no `/AP`) is no longer flagged for lacking a
  normal appearance (§6.3); and a signature dictionary's `/Contents` (the CMS placeholder, which can
  exceed 32767 bytes) is no longer flagged by the string-length limit (§6.1.13). Both match veraPDF.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` content-stream rules.** Four PDF/A-2b/2u/2a preflight checks driven by
  an in-process content-stream scan: content-stream operators must be defined in ISO 32000-1, even
  inside `BX`/`EX` (§6.2.2-1); a page that references named resources must have an explicitly
  associated `/Resources` dictionary rather than relying on an inherited one (§6.2.2-2); an inline
  image's filter must be one of the ISO 32000-1 Table 6 filters permitted for inline images, not
  LZW, Crypt, or JPXDecode (§6.1.10-1); and a composite (Type 0) font with an embedded CMap must not
  produce a CID greater than 65,535 (§6.1.13-10). Each is scoped to page content streams (form
  XObject, Type 3 glyph, and annotation appearance streams are deferred) and cross-validated against
  veraPDF 1.30.2. Parity coverage rises to PDF/A-2b 80.9%, 2u 81.2%, 2a 78.4%.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **`VellumPdf.Conformance` package.** In-process PDF/A and PDF/UA preflight validation, so callers
  can check conformance without the external veraPDF Docker image. `PdfPreflight.Validate` opens a
  PDF through `VellumPdf.Reader` and runs a registry of clean-room conformance rules authored from
  the ISO specifications, returning a `PreflightResult` of machine-readable assertions (rule id, ISO
  clause, severity, object reference). Rules are registered explicitly — no reflection — so the
  package is AOT- and trim-ready. Each rule documents its deferred edges (e.g. resources nested in
  form XObjects, the ParentTree↔MCID bijection). Coverage:
  - **PDF/A-2b (ISO 19005-2)** — file structure: header and binary marker (§6.1.2), trailer `/ID`
    (§6.1.3), no external streams (§6.1.7.1); graphics: output intents and device colour
    (§6.2.3/§6.2.4.3), graphics-state `/TR`,`/TR2`,`/HTP` (§6.2.5), rendering intents (§6.2.6),
    forbidden image and form-XObject keys including PostScript and reference XObjects
    (§6.2.8/§6.2.9), blend modes (§6.2.10); fonts: embedding (§6.2.11.4.1), subtype and Widths
    consistency (§6.2.11.2), CIDToGIDMap (§6.2.11.3.2), TrueType encoding (§6.2.11.6), and — via an
    in-process sfnt font-program parser — glyph presence (§6.2.11.4.1), glyph-width consistency
    (§6.2.11.5), and `.notdef` references (§6.2.11.8); annotations: flags, appearance, forbidden
    subtypes (§6.3); interactive forms: widget/field actions, `NeedAppearances`, `NeedsRendering`,
    XFA (§6.4); actions: forbidden and named actions, catalog/page additional-actions (§6.5); and —
    via an in-process XMP packet parser — metadata: serialisation (§6.6.2.1), property provenance
    and extension-schema structure (§6.6.2.3), and the PDF/A identification schema (§6.6.4).
  - **PDF/A-2u / PDF/A-2a** — character-to-Unicode (§6.2.11.7) and tagged logical structure (§6.8).
  - **PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1)** — identification, tagging, natural language, document title, and tab
    order.

  Every rule's positive and negative paths are cross-validated against veraPDF 1.30.2 in CI through
  a corpus of writer-produced fixtures. (#50)
- **`VellumPdf.Reader` cross-reference and object streams.** The reader now parses cross-reference
  streams (§7.5.8), hybrid-reference files, and object streams (§7.5.7), resolving objects packed in
  object streams. It decodes the FlateDecode / LZWDecode / ASCIIHexDecode / ASCII85Decode /
  RunLengthDecode filter chain with PNG and TIFF predictors, with decompression-size guards. (#107)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **PAdES long-term validation (B-LT and B-LTA).** `PdfSignatureSettings.Level` selects the
  signature level: `B_B` (baseline), `B_T` (signature timestamp), `B_LT` (embedded revocation
  evidence), and `B_LTA` (archive timestamp). At `B_LT` and above, signing gathers the signer
  and timestamp-authority certificate chains, fetches OCSP/CRL revocation data through
  `PdfSignatureSettings.RevocationClient`, and writes a `/DSS` (Document Security Store) with
  per-signature `/VRI` as an incremental revision. `B_LTA` adds a `/DocTimeStamp`
  (`/SubFilter /ETSI.RFC3161`) over that revision, then a final cumulative DSS so the archive
  timestamp's own certificate chain and revocation are embedded too. The original signature is
  left byte-for-byte intact, so it stays valid. (#49)
- **`IRevocationClient` and `HttpRevocationClient`.** A pluggable revocation surface mirroring
  the timestamp client. The default HTTP client reads the OCSP responder (AIA) and CRL
  distribution points from a certificate and fetches the evidence over HTTP. Before embedding,
  it validates a CRL (correct issuer, and the certificate not listed as revoked) and requires a
  successful OCSP response status. The abstraction keeps the core offline and the tests
  deterministic.
- **`VellumPdf.Reader` package.** Opens an existing signed PDF (classic cross-reference tables,
  unencrypted) and exposes its catalog and signatures. It is the foundation the LTV path builds
  on, and the first slice of a general reader (see the roadmap). Cross-reference streams, object
  streams, and encryption are not supported yet and raise a clear error.

### Fixed

- **Signed PDF/UA-1 tab order.** A page that carries an annotation now declares `/Tabs /S` under
  PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1 §7.18.3). Signing adds a signature (and, at B-LTA, a document-timestamp)
  widget annotation, so without this a signed PDF/UA-1 document was rejected by veraPDF. Signed
  B-LTA output now validates as PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-2a, and PDF/UA-1.

## [1.5.6] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Structure tree allocation guard.** A hand-built tagged structure tree whose
  `PdfStructElem.Mcid` is set to a very large value (or `int.MaxValue`) now raises a clear
  exception instead of overflowing or attempting a multi-gigabyte ParentTree allocation. The
  per-page ParentTree array is indexed by MCID; documents tagged through the canvas are
  unaffected (their MCIDs are dense and sequential).

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-16

Closes the residual hardening items from the 2026-06-12 full-library review (#83, #84).

### Added

- **Signature widget page.** `PdfSignatureSettings.SignaturePage` (0-based, default 0) chooses
  which page carries the invisible signature widget; an out-of-range index is rejected.

### Fixed

- **Tagged-PDF MCID range.** The per-page structure ParentTree is sized by the highest MCID on
  the page rather than the leaf-element count, so non-contiguous MCIDs (for example when the MCID
  counter is shared with container elements) produce a valid sparse array instead of aborting the
  save. The marked-content-to-structure mapping is unchanged.
- **Form field text encoding.** AcroForm field names, values, and choice options are written as
  proper PDF text strings — Latin-1 when representable, otherwise UTF-16BE with a byte-order mark —
  instead of silently replacing non-Latin-1 characters with `?`. Field text that the Standard-14
  appearance font cannot render now raises a clear error rather than writing `?` into the appearance.
- **Word wrap.** Wrapping handles `\r\n` and lone `\r` as line breaks and splits on Unicode
  whitespace, so Windows line endings no longer leave a stray carriage-return glyph and tabs and
  runs of spaces wrap correctly.
- **Nested list markers.** A nested ordered list uses its configured numbering scheme
  (alphabetic, roman, decimal) instead of always falling back to decimal.
- **Justified text.** Word-gap counting uses one tokenization for both measurement and drawing,
  so justified spacing is consistent between embedded and Standard-14 fonts.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **JPEG 2000 in PDF/A.** A JPEG 2000 image in a PDF/A-2 document now carries the JP2 box
  structure (`ihdr`/`colr`) that veraPDF reads for clause 6.2.8.3, rather than only the bare
  codestream — which reported 0 colour channels and 0 bit depth and failed validation. The
  codestream is preserved byte-for-byte: for a JP2 source only ancillary metadata boxes are
  dropped, so the embedded image never grows and usually shrinks; a raw `.j2k` codestream is
  wrapped in a minimal JP2. For a `/JPXDecode` image, `/BitsPerComponent` is emitted only when
  its value is one PDF/A permits (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) — the codestream still defines the bit depth.

### Changed

- **JBIG2 embedding.** A JBIG2 image no longer writes an empty `/DecodeParms` dictionary when it
  has no global segments, and the end-of-page segment is dropped from the embedded stream
  (alongside the end-of-file segment) to match the PDF embedded organisation. The end-of-stripe
  segment is retained because it carries image data for striped pages.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Signature byte-range coverage.** A signed PDF no longer writes a comment between the
  `/Contents` key and its hex-string value, so the value is a direct hex string as signature
  validators expect. veraPDF 1.30+ rejected the previous output on clause 6.4.3-1
  (`doesByteRangeCoverEntireDocument`) even though the byte range and the CMS signature were
  correct. The internal placeholder is now located by anchoring on the `/ByteRange` placeholder,
  which keeps the patch resistant to crafted `Reason`/`Location` metadata.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Link URIs with non-BMP characters.** A hyperlink URL containing a character above the Basic
  Multilingual Plane (for example an emoji) is now percent-encoded as its full UTF-8 byte sequence
  rather than two `U+FFFD` replacement characters. URLs without such characters are unaffected.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-12

A hardening release from a full-library review: bug fixes, malformed-input robustness, and a
few small additions. No public API was removed.

### Added

- **PNG transparency.** The `tRNS` chunk is now applied — palette images gain an alpha `/SMask`
  and greyscale/truecolour images gain a colour-key `/Mask` — instead of the transparency being
  dropped.
- **Outline open/closed state.** `PdfOutlineEntry.IsExpanded` (default `true`) controls whether a
  bookmark renders expanded or collapsed and is reflected in the ISO 32000 signed `/Count`.

### Fixed

- **Layout pagination.** A list item taller than a page no longer loops or duplicates content — it
  resumes on the next page via the content overflow, and the item marker is drawn once. Table cells
  whose text wraps are drawn wrapped instead of overlapping the next row; automatic column widths
  use the cell's own font, including embedded fonts; row spans are no longer split across a page
  break; and the total-page count behind the `{pages}` footer token matches the rendered output.
  Paragraph wrapping honours embedded newlines.
- **Document integrity.** Writing the same `PdfDocument` twice, or writing a document with no
  pages, now throws instead of producing a duplicated or invalid file. Signing a document that also
  has form fields keeps those fields, including fields on pages other than the first.
- **Fonts.** A malformed `hmtx` or `name` table now fails with `InvalidDataException` rather than an
  unexpected exception, and a CID-keyed CFF that falls back to whole-font embedding no longer
  advertises a subset tag.

### Security

- **Malformed-input robustness.** The CCITT, GIF, and TIFF decoders and the font tables reject
  corrupt, truncated, or out-of-range input with `InvalidDataException` instead of over-reading,
  looping, or crashing with an out-of-range exception; the opt-in CCITT raster path now advances
  correctly. Cross-reference byte offsets are bounded, and an offset too large for the format is
  rejected rather than silently truncated.
- **Output escaping.** Caller-supplied resource and marked-content names are escaped so they cannot
  inject content-stream operators; XML-illegal control characters are stripped from XMP metadata;
  non-ASCII link URIs are percent-encoded; and duplicate form-field names and the reserved radio
  `Off` export value are rejected.
- **Signing.** The signature `/Contents` placeholder is located by a unique sentinel and fails
  closed on an ambiguous match, so signature metadata can no longer derail the patch; the `/M` date
  and the CMS signing-time now share a single value. An encryption decrypt round-trip is now
  exercised on CI.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **PAdES B-T signature timestamps.** A signature can now carry an RFC-3161 timestamp over the
  signature value, embedded as a CMS signature-timestamp unsigned attribute, to reach PAdES B-T.
  Set `PdfSignatureSettings.TimestampClient` to an `ITimestampClient`; the supplied
  `HttpTimestampClient` requests a token from any RFC-3161 Time Stamping Authority over HTTP, or a
  caller can plug in their own client. When no timestamp client is set the signature is unchanged
  (PAdES B-B). The reserved `/Contents` space is enlarged automatically for a timestamped
  signature left at the default size.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **JBIG2 images.** `Jbig2ImageLoader` reads JBIG2 bilevel images and embeds them as 1-bit `/JBIG2Decode`. A standalone JBIG2 file is parsed and split into its page segments and a `/JBIG2Globals` side-stream (symbol and pattern dictionaries and tables), as the PDF embedded organisation requires; a file with no global segments stays self-contained.
- **JPEG 2000 images.** `JpxImageLoader` reads JP2 box files and raw codestreams (`.j2k`/`.j2c`), takes width, height, component count, and bit depth from the `ihdr`/`SIZ` header and colour space from the `colr` box, and embeds the codestream as `/JPXDecode`.
- **CCITT Group 3 TIFF.** The TIFF loader now reads Compression 2 (Modified Huffman) and 3 (Group 3 / T.4) in addition to Group 4, mapping the `T4Options` tag to the `/CCITTFaxDecode` `/DecodeParms` (`K`, `EncodedByteAlign`, `EndOfLine`). `CcittImageLoader.Load` gained an `endOfLine` parameter for the Group 3 end-of-line convention.
- **Opt-in raster decode.** A new `ImageLoadOptions.DecodeMode` (`Passthrough` by default, or `DecodeToRaster`) decodes a codestream to pixels and re-encodes it losslessly with FlateDecode for viewers without the native codec. Raster decode covers CCITT Group 3 one-dimensional data and JBIG2 MMR generic regions; the other variants (CCITT two-dimensional and Group 4, JBIG2 arithmetic, symbol, text, and halftone segments, and all JPEG 2000) report `NotSupportedException` when raster decode is requested and continue to pass through unchanged. Passthrough stays the default and is always lossless.

### Security

- **Image-codec hardening.** The JBIG2 segment parser, the JPEG 2000 box and marker walker, and the CCITT decoder bound every offset and length against the input, cap segment counts and decoded-output size, and reject truncated, malformed, or oversized data with `InvalidDataException`/`NotSupportedException` rather than over-reading, looping, or exhausting memory. Valid images are unaffected.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Interlaced (Adam7) PNG.** Interlaced PNGs now load; the loader de-interlaces the seven Adam7 passes instead of rejecting the file.
- **16-bit image fidelity.** 16-bit-per-channel PNG and TIFF images keep their full bit depth by default (`BitsPerComponent 16`) rather than being reduced to 8 bits. Pass `new ImageLoadOptions { BitDepth = ImageBitDepth.ReduceToEight }` to the new `PngImageLoader.Load` / `TiffImageLoader.Load` overloads to opt into 8-bit downsampling for smaller output. Images that must be transcoded are always re-encoded losslessly with FlateDecode; JPEG and CCITT data is embedded verbatim with no re-encoding.
- **More TIFF compressions.** The TIFF loader now reads LZW (including the horizontal-differencing predictor), new-style JPEG (single strip, any photometric including YCbCr, embedded as DCTDecode), Group-4 fax (embedded as CCITTFaxDecode), and planar (`PlanarConfiguration 2`) images, in addition to the existing uncompressed and PackBits. `FillOrder 2` data is normalised to MSB-first.
- **CCITT Group 3/4 passthrough.** `CcittImageLoader` wraps raw CCITT-compressed bytes as a 1-bit `/CCITTFaxDecode` image with the matching `/DecodeParms` (K, Columns, Rows, BlackIs1) without decoding; the viewer decodes at render time. Single-strip Group-4 TIFFs are routed through it, with polarity taken from the TIFF photometric. The new image paths are checked on CI with veraPDF under PDF/A-2b.

### Security

- **Image-codec hardening.** The TIFF-LZW decoder and the interlaced-PNG and TIFF strip readers bound their reads and reject corrupt, truncated, or oversized input — invalid LZW codes, output-length mismatches, decompression bombs, out-of-range strip offsets, and hostile dimensions — with `InvalidDataException`/`NotSupportedException` rather than over-reading, looping, or exhausting memory. Valid images are unaffected.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **OpenType-CFF font subsetting.** CFF (`.otf`) fonts are now subsetted rather than embedded whole. Used charstrings are kept verbatim; unused glyphs and unreachable global and local subroutines are dropped, which cuts a typical small-glyph subset by roughly 70%. CID-keyed or unparseable CFF falls back to whole-font embedding.
- **DeviceCMYK and ICC-based colour.** `PdfDocument.SetPdfAOutputIntent` and `UseCmykOutputIntent` set the PDF/A output intent (the default stays sRGB). `RegisterIccBasedColorSpace` registers an ICCBased colour space, painted with the new `PdfCanvas.SetFillColorSpace`/`SetStrokeColorSpace` and `SetFillColor`/`SetStrokeColor` operators. `IccProfiles.Srgb` and `IccProfiles.GenericCmyk` supply built-in profiles for callers without their own. DeviceCMYK content validates as PDF/A once a CMYK output intent is set; both paths are checked on CI with veraPDF.
- **`ColorCmyk`** colour type in the layout API, with `FromRgb` and `ToRgbApproximate` conversions.
- **cmap subtable formats 0 and 6.** Fonts whose character map uses these formats, in addition to format 4, now embed and extract text correctly.

### Security

- **Font-parser hardening.** The CFF subsetter and cmap parser bound operand-stack depth and subroutine nesting, use overflow-safe offset checks, and reject negative or zero INDEX offsets and out-of-range cmap ranges. A malformed font falls back to whole-font embedding or fails with a clear error instead of throwing an unhandled exception or exhausting the stack. Valid fonts are unaffected.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **PDF/A-2a (level A) conformance**, validated on every CI run with strict veraPDF.
- **PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1) conformance** via `PdfConformance.PdfUA1`, validated on CI with strict veraPDF — emits the `pdfuaid` XMP schema, `/ViewerPreferences << /DisplayDocTitle true >>`, and marks decorative content (table borders/fills, separators, running header/footer bands) as `/Artifact`.
- **Document and per-element language.** A `Language` property on the layout `Document`, `Paragraph`, `Heading`, `ListItem`, and table `Cell` (and on kernel `PdfDocument` / `PdfStructElem`) emits catalog `/Lang` and XMP `dc:language`.
- **`PdfCanvas.BeginArtifactMarkedContent`** — marks decorative content as a PDF `/Artifact` (no MCID).
- **Accessible tables.** `PdfStructElem.TableHeaderScope` emits `/A << /O /Table /Scope … >>` on header cells so assistive tech can resolve column headers.

### Changed

- The tagged-PDF structure tree now writes an MCID-validated `/ParentTree` and no longer emits a self-referential `/RoleMap` (a circular role mapping, which PDF/UA-1 forbids).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Public-API surface lock.** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers` is
  wired to every shippable project. Any accidental addition, removal, or rename
  of a public symbol is a build error unless the corresponding
  `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` baseline is updated, guarding the API contract ahead
  of 1.0.
- **veraPDF PDF/A-2b/2u CI gate.** The official `verapdf/cli` Docker image is
  pulled on every CI run and exercises the generated archival documents (embedded
  font, table, image, and tagged variants) under strict PDF/A-2b and PDF/A-2u
  profiles. A non-compliant report fails the build with the full rule list
  attached.

### Changed

- **Deterministic output.** Document identifiers (`/ID`) and producer timestamps
  are now pinnable at the call site, so bytes produced from identical inputs are
  bit-for-bit identical across builds. This is required for reliable golden-file
  snapshot tests and for reproducible NuGet packages.

### Security

- **Font-parser hardening.** The TrueType/OpenType parser now fails cleanly on
  malformed or hostile input — throwing `InvalidDataException` on corrupt or
  truncated data and `NotSupportedException` on unsupported variants — rather than
  crashing with an unexpected exception, hanging, or exhausting memory.
- **Image-parser hardening.** The PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF parsers apply the
  same defensive posture: bounded reads, early rejection of structurally invalid
  headers, and no unbounded allocations driven by attacker-controlled length
  fields.
